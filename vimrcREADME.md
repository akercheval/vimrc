### My .vimrc
Frankly, this is mainly up here for me so that I can more easily transfer my work environment between 
computers/prove to my friends how my text editor is better than theirs, but if you'd like to download it
(because it is great), then by all means!

I use, on top of this, [the ultimate configuration of amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), 
[solarized for vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Solarized), and [inconsolata dz](http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/).

My recommendation is to download all those things and then copy my vimrc, so all your configuration files will be linked together
properly by default. And, of course, have fun!
